During the week from the 21st until the 25th of February the LIDARs were in operation in front of the GFI building. We were able to hook the instruments to a RapberryPi computer and set up automatic uploading of data. 
We were also able to develop advanced scanning patterns enabling the tilting of the scanning plane. 

Getting ready for the Voss campaign in May!
