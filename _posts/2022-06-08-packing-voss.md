Thanks to the amazing people at Voss that were hosting our instruments, we were able to prolong our stay for a week into the month of June with some beautiful convective days. Thank you, everyone that was involved in the Voss campaign! 

It's now time to pack up and drive the LIDARs home. Next deployment will be in July at Starmoen.
