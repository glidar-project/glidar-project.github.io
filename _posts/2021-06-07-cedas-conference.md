The very first [conference](https://cedasconf.w.uib.no/) organised by the Centre for Data Science at the University of Bergen took place on the 1st and 2nd of June 2021 in Scandic Hotel in Bergen. 

Our gLidar team was represented by two posters, one covering the measurement techniques, one dedicated to parameter space analysis of a convection model.
