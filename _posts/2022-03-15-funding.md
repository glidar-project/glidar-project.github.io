Today the gLidar project has been awarded a research grant for financing data colection. The money is available until the March 2023 (including). This could not be more timely addition as we are planning the Voss campaign in May and a summer school at Elverum in July.

The money will mostly be used to finance logistics and instruments necessary for the data collection.
