The location at Voss is amazing for several reasons, one of which is the local skydiving club. In the peak season they fly from the ground level to 4000 meters, every day (except Sundays) from 9am to 9pm every 25 minutes. This is an unprecedented profiling opportunity. We got in touch with the club and were kindly allowed to have an iMet senesor installed on one of the struts under the wing. The first test flight took place on the 24th of April, and we are looking forward to the data. We plan to complement our LIDAR and PG observations with measurements from the skydiving plane.
