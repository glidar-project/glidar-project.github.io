We have designed a new instrument box housing the iMet sensor for in flight observation from a paraglider. The box has a double roof to shield the sun's radiation and an integrated button at the bottom to power the instrument. A cutout at the back end allows charging and data trasfer without extracting the instrument and risking damage to fragile sensors. The box mounts on a standard GoPro mount which makes it easy to place the instrument on a helmet and tilt it into the wind.
