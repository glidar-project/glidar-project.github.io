title: CHESS Summer Shool Starmoen
---
The CHESS Summer School is now over. We had an amazing time packed with incredible lectures, collecting valuable data, and learning about convection from a seat of a glider plane. On the morning of the last day every student held a short presentation to show our analysis of the collected measurements. 
A pdf document with all the presentations can be found here: [link]({{ '/assets/pdf/SummerSchool_StudentPresentation.pdf' | relative_url}})
