We have discovered a bias in the temperatures measured at high velocity flights using our 3D printed instrument box.  We attributed the bias to adiabatic heating caused by compressed air inside the instrument box. Running a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation confirmed our suspicion of increased pressure. We were able to quantify and correct the bias using a theoretical formula that nicely fits the simulated data.
