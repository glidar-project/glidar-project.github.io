Everyone from the gLidar project will be involved in the 
[CHESS Summer School](https://chess.w.uib.no/activities/upcoming-activities/summer-school-on-land-atmosphere-interaction-processes-and-convection/)
on land--atmosphere interaction processes and convection. 
We are already organizing the shipping and the placement of our LIDAR instruments at the Starmoen airfield. We are also preparing talks and data analysis from Voss to share with our international colleagues during the summer school.
