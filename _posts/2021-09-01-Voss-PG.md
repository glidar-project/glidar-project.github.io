title: Paragliding with iMet in Voss 21-23 Aug
category: PG
---

The first paragliding data acquisition using the iMet sensor took place on the 21st of August 2021. 
In total there were three days of flying with seven flights with over 14h30min of airtime in total. 

The conditions were quite extraordinary which allowed for two ~5hr flights, one on Saturday, one on Sunday.
You can see the potential temperatures recorded on Saturday in the picture below. The graph shows the warming of the atmosphere, as well as the magnitude of the temperature anomalies inside the thermal.

A detailed analysis showing the mixing coefficients and comparison with the AROME model is in progress.
